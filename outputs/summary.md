Council must adopt its operating budget for the year, council must  buy bylaws set a rate of taxation. A few concerns I have,  I wanted to share with council with this particular proposed 2025 financier. "I noted at least one  resident got back to me. Actually, there's a couple of them, a few that had input questions to our  council. But as you know, we don't have question period. We don't really have delegations to this special  meeting," he said. "I'm kind of frustrated at that because  people are now calling me and saying, Mark, other than you expressing our c. ition or series of questions for the  financial plan," he says. "Are we just now relying on bank rant and rave for the community to engage  with us?" "There's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with council in general," he says. "It's unfortunate we've come to this situation where the public really is relegated to the backwoods" "I came to council here wanting to sharpen my pencil as much  as I could not to cut indiscriminately," he says. "I personally have seen that I'm going to  have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes, 18%" I guarantee you that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times  mine. And they're going to go ballistic if their rate increases 18%. I would like our  council to set a goal of reducing expenditures going forward, not increasing them just because we have it. Councillor: "Affordability and cost of living is the top priority for all political  parties" "We have to, on the  grassroots here in the municipality, realize that people don't have an endless credit card to spend" Councillor Kaczynski: "I would like to point out, Councillor Miller, that it's not  $2 million, but it's $3.2 million" "The gravy train going to be over shortly, so that's my concern and my input," he says. The mechanisms for this budget were totally complied with there. We did have our  planning hearing or the public hearing there last week, I believe, there and all the questions  were answered. I know who you were talking to, and I don't know whether you mentioned his name or not. "We have a very good financial position there, and it shows in the progress the steps that  we're taking, but we don't take it furiously," he says. "We went detailed by detail,  line by line, and saved where we can, and you know, the wants as opposed to the needs" "I'm going to be paying a price for that. My neighbors,  we've had discussions about that, and unfortunately that's out of our control with the assessment  year being this year," he said. 7% increase within the armors, Springfield. Some might even pay a little bit less there,  but it's going as high as 21% and that would be myself and my neighbors around me there. So I do understand the concerns from Councillors Miller, Kaczynski there. "We've got a plan for  the future, and that's what we're doing, because these costs and everything is not going down to keep  going up," says Councillor Miller. "It's good we have a  council because we have differen" I think at 18 or 17% average increase of  the public knew that, they would go ballistic. They would not be embracing us. I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Deputy Mayor in  this particular situation. I think we can do better. "People  are fed up and aren't going to put up with this anymore, and we'll see it in October of 26," says Councillor Warren. "If we put up the information very clearly that it was going  to lead to a 17% increase, I think you'd have this room packed" The meeting was adjourned at 617 PM. Councillor Miller and Mayor Kaczynski were the sole present. The meeting was called to order at 6:30 PM. The council will meet again on Tuesday.

Three, an estimate of operating revenue and expenditures for the following fiscal year and four a five year capital expenditure program. Council must buy bylaws set a rate of taxation.

"We've eliminated question period. for the public to engage with us. But this one individual, as you know, it's in our agenda  kind of hidden from the public," he said. "This one individual did submit comments to the CEO and express that  those comments be how can I say publicly known" "I'm kind of frustrated at that because  people are now calling me and saying, Mark, other than you expressing our concerns at these meetings,  there's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with council in general," he says. "The public really  is relegated to the backwoods. And so my next point is with the provincial reassessment this year in  2025, we have an addition of $2 million to our kitty," he says. "And so we've taken upon us to find ways to  spend that $2million" "I personally have seen that I'm going to  have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes, 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our  municipality," he says. "I guarantee you that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times  mine" "We got $2 million extra because of the reassessment? But yet we're spending that like, I want to be cautious  when I say, but we're Spending it just because we have it," he says. "We've got some very important and  critical projects coming forward as we all know. And we have to address those" Councillor Kaczynski: "We have to, on the  grassroots here in the municipality, realize that people don't have an endless credit card to spend  money with" Council Miller: "I would like to point out, Councillor Miller, that it's not  $2 million, but it's $3.2 million" Councillor Kaczynski: "We have to be really, you know,  frugal with our money right now" "The gravy train going to be over shortly, so that's my concern and my input" I know who you were talking to, and I don't know whether you mentioned his name or not. And those questions were answered by me on the record there, so they're like, I think they were referred to as flags or something like that. So  I do understand the situation that both Councillors were talking about because Kaczynski and Miller,  and we, I totally understand. "We went through each one of these, as you know,  through our community of a holes and working groups there. We went detailed by detail,  line by line, and saved where we can," he said. "Most of them are the taxpayers within the armors, they fill themselves" "I'm going to be paying a price for that. My neighbors,  we've had discussions about that, and unfortunately that's out of our control with the assessment  year being this year. Yes, we got a pretty good amount of money. We got apretty good amount  of money two years ago. I think we got 2.2 million," he said. "Everybody does have an input into this, the budget, and that was express  quite eloquently by several people there that came up to us last week, as well as time goes on," he says. "I just like to say that we did a really good job in working through this budget,  and we, like I said, I said it time before that we went and reduced the mill rate once," he adds. Councillor Miller: "I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Deputy Mayor in  this particular situation" "I think at 18 or 17% average increase of  the public knew that, they would go ballistic" " Manitobans aren't getting paid that much more, and we're getting squeezed right to the  the, you know, the nines," he says. "People  are fed up and aren't going to put up with this anymore" The Council of the Army Springfield adopts the 2025 financial plan. Councilor Warren, the premier  fuel and the mayor, Teran, those opposed. The meeting adjourned at 617 PM,  the meeting was held on February 26. The council's.  is adjourned. Thank you very much people for attending in the audience and online and  the council's own. council. The meeting will resume in the near future.

## Action Items
Mayor Patrick Terriam: "Please review the meeting transcript and extract clear action items" Mayor: "If I can get a mover or those in support  to the adoption of the agenda, that would be unanimous an unanimous" The council of the Army Springfield adopt the 2025 financial plan consisting of one  and operating budget to a capital budget. Under Section 3.304 subsection 1, no later than May 15th  of each year. This is the municipal act. Council must buy bylaws set a rate of taxation. So I assume that in the next coming meetings, we're going to have a  bylaw to adopt the financial plan. I yeah, we pass a financial plan by resolution and then that becomes  schedule A to the bylaw for the taxation. I'm just wondering when people submit comments, wasn't th. t comments to the CEO and express that  those comments be how can I say publicly known. We don't really have delegations to this special  meeting. So there's no opportunity for the public to engage with us. Mark O'Mara: Are we just now relying on bank rant and rave for the community to engage  with us? "This seems to be really the only mechanism. I'm kind of frustrated at that," he says. The only mechanism they have now are two things, one to institute recall legislation,  which of course won't happen very quickly. And the second is to vote differently at the next  selection in October of 2026. So it's unfortunate we've come to this situation where the public really  is relegated to the backwoods. "I personally have seen that I'm going to  have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes, 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our  municipality," he says. "I guarantee you that my neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times  mine" "We're spending it just because we have it. And so we've got some very important and  critical projects coming forward as we all know," he said. "If our expenses keep rising the way they are, you know, people are stretched to the limit" Councillor Kaczynski: "I would like to point out, Councillor Miller, that it's not  $2 million, but it's $3.2 million" Council Miller: "We're going to receive from that 18% increase by the reassessment of houses" "The gravy train going to be over shortly, so that's my concern and my input," says Councillor Kaczynski. "We did have our  planning hearing or the public hearing there last week and all the questions  were answered" "We have a very good financial position there, and it shows in the progress the steps that  we're taking, but we don't take it furiously," he said. "We went through each one of these, as you know,  through our community of a holes and working groups there," he added. "We went detailed by detail,  line by line, and saved where we can, and you know, the wants as opposed to the needs were all  we were all they're all weighed. So we relied quite heavily on our other directors for their  budgets" "We were able to reduce our, excuse me, our mill rate by 3.1 per six," he says. "That's on average,  a 17% increase within the armors, Springfield" Mayor: "I just like to say that we did a really good job in working through this budget" Mayor: "All administration and staff that are involved in the budget take it seriously with every residence  dollar" "We've got a plan for the future, and that's what we're doing, because these costs and everything is not going down to keep  going up," says Councillor Miller. "I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Deputy Mayor in  this particular situation," he adds. " Manitobans aren't getting paid that much more, and we're getting squeezed right to the  the, you know, the nines. And so I think there is improvement to make, and I cannot support this  budget proposed as it is," he said. "If we put up the information very clearly that it was going  to lead to a 17% increase, I think you'd have this room packed and packed andpacked" Councillor Warren, the premier  fuel and the mayor, Teran, those opposed. Councilor Miller and Kaczynski, the sole past. Councillor Melinda and the Mayor of Fuel and at 617 PM, the meeting is adjourned.

We don't  have delegations and we really have no  mechanism for the public to engage with us" "We don't really have delegations to this special  meeting. So there's no opportunity for the public to engage with us at all" "I'm just wondering when people submit comments, wasn't that supposed to be the  mechanism where the public still has the opportunity to publicly have their concerns shared with the community?" "There's no ability for the public to engage with not only the bureaucracy but with council in general," he says. "I'm kind of frustrated at that because  people are now calling me and saying, Mark, other than you expressing our concerns" "It's unfortunate we've come to this situation where the public really  is relegated to the backwoods," he says. "I came to council here wanting to sharpen my pencil as much  as I could not to cut indiscriminately" "I personally have seen that I'm going to  have an 18% increase in my municipal taxes, 18% and I don't have the biggest house in our  municipality," he says. "My neighbor across the street has a house worth at least five times  mine" "We have to, on the  grassroots here in the municipality, realize that people don't have an endless credit card to spend  money with," he says. "We saw  it in the election yesterday, affordability and cost of living is the top priority for all political  parties" Councillor Kaczynski: I would like to point out, Councillor Miller, that it's not  $2 million, but it's $3.2 million. We're going to receive from that 18% increase by the reassessment of houses. "The gravy train going to be over shortly, so that's my concern and my input," says Councillor Kaczynski. "The mechanisms for this budget were totally complied with there" "We went detailed by detail,  line by line, and saved where we can, and you know, the wants as opposed to the needs were all  we were all they're all weighed. So we r ll those questions there, and it was the questions were answered by or the answers  were provided by administration," he said. "I'm going to be paying a price for that. My neighbors,  we've had discussions about that, and unfortunately that's out of our control with the assessment  year being this year," he said. "It's not going to help a lot of the taxpayers there, and that's on average,  a 17% increase within the armors, Springfield. Some might even pay a little bit less there,  but it's going as high as 21%," he said. Mayor: "I just like to say that we did a really good job in working through this budget" Mayor: "All administration and staff that are involved in the budget take it seriously with every residence  dollar" "I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Deputy Mayor in  this particular situation. I think we can do better," says Councillor Miller. " Manitobans aren't getting paid that much more, and we're getting squeezed" I cannot support this  budget proposed as it is because I think we can use the excuse that the people had an opportunity  for a public open house. If we put up the information very clearly that it was going  to lead to a 17% increase, I think you'd have this room packed. People  are fed up and aren't going to put up with this anymore, and we'll see it in October of 26. Councillor Warren, the premier  fuel and the mayor, Teran, those opposed. penditures  for the following fiscal year and four a five-year capital expenditure program.
